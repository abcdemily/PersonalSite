		<h1>Emily Meltzer</h1>
		<p><i> graphic designer, photographer, web designer, typography nerd. and lover of all things design related! </i> </p>

		<h3> If you were a typeface, what would you be?</h3>

		<p> I was asked this question once on a job interview, and it was my most favorite question! I would be Bodoni. It is a beautiful and classic font. I love how each variant has something special about it. The Bodoni Italic ampersand is my favorite. (I could spend hours drawing ampersands). </p>

		<h3> What helps you get motivated when you are having a creative “brain fart”? </h3>
		
		<p> I could say I take the Michael Scott approach and have someone spin me around in my chair because “a spinning brain is a working brain”, but i’ll leave that technique to him. </p>

		<p> I like to start by plugging in my headphones. Next to design, music has always been a huge part of my life. I love how it inspires me and gets my creative juices flowing. Next, I will browse my favorite creative sites. The Dieline for packaging, Logopond for logos, Designspiration for anything, and of course Pinterest. I also love Reddit. You never know when a creative strike is going to happen! </p>
